# PineScript Language Model (LLM) README

## Introduction

Welcome to the PineScript Language Model (LLM), an expertly trained tool designed for creating advanced indicators with unparalleled precision, free from the common errors associated with typical GPT models. This comprehensive package includes the entire 2023 PineScript User Manual and a collection of example scripts, providing valuable context for seamless PineScript compilation.

## Features

- **Discord Bot Integration**: The LLM is seamlessly incorporated into a Discord Bot, enabling users to apply it within server-client environments.
  
- **Mobile Access**: Enjoy the flexibility of utilizing the LLM on various devices such as mobile phones and tablets for personal use, even when away from a traditional desktop setting.

- **Custom Database and Prompt**: The LLM is structured into a database with a customized prompt, refining its output specifically for PineScript-related queries.

- **Monetization Options**: Offer the LLM as a sub-model for users or implement a pay-per-use model, similar to the donation-based approach employed within the creator's server.

## Installation

1. **API Configuration**: Adjust the API keys and engine settings to align with your API access restrictions. The primary file is built for GPT-4, but users without access to this API can easily switch back to GPT-3.5-Turbo.

2. **Donation Link**: A donation link is provided for users who wish to contribute to the continued development and maintenance of the LLM. All donations go towards supporting the creator's children.

## Usage

Follow these steps to unleash the power of the PineScript Language Model:

1. Clone the repository.
2. Configure API keys and access settings.
3. Run the main script with your chosen API (GPT-4 or GPT-3.5-Turbo).
4. Explore advanced PineScript capabilities with confidence.
